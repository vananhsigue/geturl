# geturl I used Beautiful Soup package on Python library for web scraping because this package is designed for fast and efficient data extraction
Specific the URL which I will scrape: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html
Inspect the webpage: On the mac, right click the web page, click on Inspect Element
Find the data I will extract: Find anchor tag <a> as this element defines a hyperlink, and a link locator by href tag.
Write the code: Use the VS code as my text Editor to code program.
Run the code: Use Debug Console to debug the code. 
Store the data in the required format: Once I have the results, I will write the data into a comma-separated values file for future use.
